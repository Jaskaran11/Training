Linux is an open-source operating system. It is like Windows, Mac, Android, etc.

Unix is also an operating system like Linux. It is an commercial OS. It consists of three parts: Kernal, Shell and Programs. Most of the Unix and Linux commands are similar in nature.

Linux kernel is a low-level system software.It provides an interface for user-level interaction.
It manages the system resources such as RAM,Disk,Processor, output devices etc.



Basic commands

Name - create a folder
purpose - creation of folder
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ mkdir linuxfolder
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads    Music     Public  temp   temp2      temporary  Training
Documents  linuxfolder  Pictures  snap    temp1  Templates  temp.txt   Videos

mkdir -v - displays message for every directory created
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ mkdir -v linuxtemp
mkdir: created directory 'linuxtemp'

-p flag => enables commands to create parent directory as necessary
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ mkdir -v -p a/b/c
mkdir: created directory 'a'
mkdir: created directory 'a/b'
mkdir: created directory 'a/b/c'

-m option => It is used to set the file mode/permission of the folder created
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ mkdir -m a=rx abc
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ mkdir -v -m o=r abcd
mkdir: created directory 'abcd'

-----------------------------------------------------------

Name - Change Directory
purpose navigate the directory in the linux terminal
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ cd Desktop

cd ~ => used to change the directory to home directory
tsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Desktop$ cd ~
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ 
cd .. => goes one directory back
d "dir name" or cd dir\ name => this used to navigate to the directory with the white spaces

-------------------------------------------------------------


Name -       Delete Folder
Purpose-  Deletes the folder  
Examples- rmdir is used to remove the emplty folder  
-p =>option each of the directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all
 components will be removed, if they are already empty, starting from the last component
-v/-verbose => this option will show the verbose info
â€“ignore-fail-on-non-empty => this option will not report failure if the direcotry is not empty

itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ rmdir linuxfolder

itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ rmdir ab
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ rmdir ab
rmdir: failed to remove 'ab': No such file or directory
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ rmdir -v a
rmdir: removing directory, 'a'
rmdir: failed to remove 'a': Directory not empty(only remove empty)

--------------------------------------------------------

rm - it is the remove command which deletes the objects such as files,directories , symbolic links etc.And, if the command has been executed it cant be undone.
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ rm temp.txt

rm -i=> this asks before deleting the file
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ rm -i temp1
rm: remove regular empty file 'temp1'?
rm -f a.txt => if the file is write protected it foces to delete it but wont work in the write protected directories
-r (recursive option) - it will perform a tree-walk and will delete all the files and sub-directories recursively normally rm donot delete directory but using this option it will delete the directory.

--------------------------------------
Rename Folder
Purpose-   Rename the named files according to regular expression perlexpr, can change name of multiple files
rename -s => it is going to ingnore the symbolic links
rename -v => verbose will show the files which is being renamed
rename -n=>if the user want  to see only final change
rename -o =>will not overwrite existing files
rename -V => shows the version
rename -help=> help message and exit

rename [options] expression replacement file...

itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -v 's/a1/b' a.txt
Substitution replacement not terminated at (user-supplied code).
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -v 's/a1/b/' a.txt
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ ls
a1.txt  aa1.txt  aa.txt  a.txt
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -v 's/a1/b/' a1.txt
a1.txt renamed as b.txt
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -n 's/a*/b/' a1.txt
rename(a1.txt, b1.txt)
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -n 's/a*/b/' *.txt
rename(aa1.txt, b1.txt)
aa.txt not renamed: b.txt already exists
a.txt not renamed: b.txt already exists
rename(b.txt, bb.txt)
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ ls
aa1.txt  aa.txt  a.txt  b.txt

-----------------------------------------------
Moving
mv stands for move. mv is used to move one or more files or directories from one place to another in a file system like UNIX. It has two distinct functions: 
(i) It renames a file or folder. 
(ii) It moves a group of files to a different directory. 

mv [Option] source destination
options 
-i =interactive it just ask for user confirmation 
-f = force moves the write protected files or the write protected destination file
-n = no clobber  prevents the overwriting of the existing files
-b = backup creates the backup of the existing file that is going to be overwritten

itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ mv a geek.txt

itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ mv -n abc geek.txt
mv: cannot move 'abc' to 'geek.txt/abc': Permission denied

itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~ mv -b b.txt geek.txt
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~ls
aa1.txt  aa.txt  geek.txt  geek.txt~
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~ mv -i aa.txt geek.txt
mv: overwrite 'geek.txt'? n
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~ ls
aa1.txt  aa.txt  geek.txt  geek.txt~

------------------------------------------

Copy
cp stands for copy. This command is used to copy files or group of files or directory. It creates an exact image of a file on a disk with different file name. cp command require at least two filenames in its arguments.
-r = recursive copying used to copy directory and all the files in it to other directory
-i = interactive with this option it asks the user confirmation
-b = backup creates the destination file backup in the same folder but different name and formats
-f = force used to copy write protected destination files 
-p = preserve it preserves the chracteristics of the souce file int destination like last modification date and time
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Practise$ touch a.txt
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Practise$ cp a.txt b.txt
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Practise$ ls
a.txt  b.txt

itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Practise$ cp -i a.txt b.txt
cp: overwrite 'b.txt'? y
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Practise$ cat b.txt
HI
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Practise$ cp -b a.txt b.txt
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Practise$ ls
a.txt  b.txt  b.txt~
$ ls -l b.txt
-r-xr-xr-x+ 1 User User 3 Nov 24 08:45 b.txt

User, group and others doesn't have writing permission.

Without -f option, command not executed
$ cp a.txt b.txt
cp: cannot create regular file 'b.txt': Permission denied

With -f option, command executed successfully
$ cp -f a.txt b.txt
root@itscheckmate:/home/itsacheckmate/Practise# ls -l a.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 itsacheckmate itsacheckmate 3 Apr 20 13:58 a.txt

Name -       Chmod
Purpose-      Change the access mode of the file i.e what user have the permission on the file 
wether they can edit it, or read or execute the file or the directory .

Reference   Class     Description
u          owner      file's owner

g          group      users who are members of
                      the file's group

o          others     users who are neither the
                      file's owner nor members of 
                      the file's group

a          all       All three of the above, same as ugo
Then there is operator which specify how the modes of files should be adjusted
Operator  Description
+         Adds the specified modes to the
          specified classes

-         Removes the specified modes from 
          the specified classes

=         The modes specified are to be made
          the exact modes for the specified 
          classes
and the the modes which indicate which permission is to be granted
r       Permission to read the file.
w       Permission to write (or delete) the file.
x       Permission to execute the file, or, in
        the case of a directory, search it.

the very first column represents the type of the file 
if its is a directory  'd' or if its a file the  '-'
then the folling 3set of letter represents the permission of the file owner
rwx =all three permission or rw- = only the read and write permission 

Then the following set off 3 letters are the group permission and other user permission
respectively 
if the directory has only x permission it means that there is premission to search the directory

root@itscheckmate:~# chmod 777 index.html (Everyone can access the file will have read,write and execute permissions)

chmod 755 - the owner will have read,write and execute permissions while other users will have only read and execute permissions -
root@itscheckmate:~# chmod 755 index.html 
root@itscheckmate:~# ls -l

Name -       shutdown
Purpose-    used to shutdown the system in a safe way.
Examples- syntax shutdown [OPTIONS] [TIME] [MESSAGE]
					sudo shutdown
					to shutdown the system at a specified time

It has 2 different formats
schedule a system shutdown at 7am:

tsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ sudo shutdown 7:00
[sudo] password for itsacheckmate: 
Shutdown scheduled for Wed 2022-04-20 07:00:00 IST, use 'shutdown -c' to cancel.

to broadcast a custom message-
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ sudo shutdown +10 "System upgrade"
Shutdown scheduled for Tue 2022-04-19 18:43:00 IST, use 'shutdown -c' to cancel.

this is to halt your system using -H option

shutdown -H
It means means stopping all CPUs and powering off also makes sure the main power is disconnected.
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ shutdown -h
Shutdown scheduled for Tue 2022-04-19 18:38:46 IST, use 'shutdown -c' to cancel.
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ means stopping all CPUs and powering off also makes sure the main power is disconnected.

sudo shutdown -c
 cannot specify a time argument, but can still broadcast a message 


shutdown -P
How to reboot using shutdown
For reboot, the option is -r.

itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~$ sudo shutdown -c "cancelling the reboot of the system"
