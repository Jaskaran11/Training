HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading

HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.

HTML Elements

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p> 

Nested HTML Elements

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.


Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.
<br>, <link>, <img>, <hr>, <meta>, <source>etc.

HTML is Not Case Sensitive

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg".
 If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
 
The width and height Attributes

The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels): 

 The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes.

HTML Headings
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

HTML Display

You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The HTML <pre> Element
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

The HTML Style Attribute

Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.
The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:
<tagname style="property:value;">

Background Color
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.

Fonts
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element.

Text Size
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:


Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment

HTML Text Formatting
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

HTML Quotation and Citation Elements
HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 

HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic

HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override
BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.
The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction.

HTML Comment Tag
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

HTML Styles - CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes.

3 ways for css -
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes
Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties
The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.
The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used

CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.

CSS Margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

HTML Links - Hyperlinks
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red

By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
    _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top - Opens the document in the full body of the w

Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag.

To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:


Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program

HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns.

Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.
td stands for table data.
Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.
Each table row starts with a <tr> and end with a </tr> tag.
Sometimes you want your cells to be headers, in those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag.
HTML Table Width

To set the width of a table, add the style attribute to the <table> element:
Using a percentage as the size unit for a width means how wide will this element be compared to its parent element, which in this case is the <body> element.

HTML Table Headers
Table headers are defined with th elements, each th element represents a table cell.

Vertical Table Headers
To use the first column as table headers, define the first cell in each row as a th element:

Align Table Headers
By default, table headers are bold and centered:
To left-align the table headers, use the CSS text-align property.

Header for Multiple Columns
You can have a header that spans over two or more columns.

To do this, use the colspan attribute on the <th> element.
Table Caption

You can add a caption that serves as a heading for the entire table.

HTML Table - Cell Padding

Cell padding is the space between the cell edges and the cell content.
By default the padding is set to 0.
To add padding on table cells, use the CSS padding property.


HTML Table - Cell Spacing

Cell spacing is the space between each cell.
By default the space is set to 2 pixels.
To change the space between table cells, use the CSS border-spacing property on the table element.

HTML Table - Rowspan
To make a cell span over multiple rows, use the rowspan attribute:

HTML Table - Zebra Stripes
If you add a background color on every other table row, you will get a nice zebra stripes effect.

The <colgroup> element is used to style specific columns of a table.
HTML Table Colgroup
If you want to style the two first columns of a table, use the <colgroup> and <col> elements. 
The <colgroup> element should be used as a container for the column specifications.
Each group are specified with a <col> element.
The span attribute specifies how many columns that gets the style.
The style attribute specifies the style to give the columns.
