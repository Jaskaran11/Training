    Data Encapsulation
    Data Abstraction
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance

#Class 
A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. The object is also called as an instance of a class.

#Four type of variables in Ruby

1.Global Variable - Starts with $ sign.Global Variable has global scope and accessible from anywhere in the program.
$global_variable=10
class Class1
    def print_global
        puts "Global variable in Class1 is #$global_variable"
    end
end
class Class2
    def print_global
        puts "Global variable in Class2 is #$global_variable"

    end
end

class1obj = Class1.new
class1obj.print_global
class2obj = Class2.new
class2obj.print_global


[Running] ruby "/home/itsacheckmate/Practise/test.rb"
Global variable in Class1 is 10
Global variable in Class2 is 10

2.Instance Variables-It begins with @.its content is restricted to whatever the object itself refers to. Two separate objects, even though they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.

class Customer1
    def initialize(id,name,addr)
        @cust_id=id
        @cust_name=name
        @cust_addr=addr
    
        puts "Customer id #@cust_id"
        puts "Customer name #@cust_name"
        puts "Customer address #@cust_addr"
    end
end

cust1=Customer1.new("1","John","Australia")
cust2=Customer1.new("2","Ron","USA")

[Running] ruby "/home/itsacheckmate/Practise/test.rb"
Customer id 1
Customer name John
Customer address Australia
Customer id 2
Customer name Ron
Customer address USA

3.Class Variables - It begins with @@. A class variable belongs to the class and it is a characteristic of a class. They need to be initialized before use.
class Customer2

    @@no_of_customers=0
    
    def initialize(id,name,addr)
        @cust_id=id
        @cust_name=name
        @cust_addr=addr
    end

    def display_details()
        puts "Customer id #@cust_id"
        puts "Customer name #@cust_name"
        puts "Customer address #@cust_addr"
    end

    def total_no_customers()

        @@no_of_customers +=1
        puts "Total number of customers: #@@no_of_customers"
    end
end

cust1 = Customer2.new("1","Virat","Delhi")
cust2 = Customer2.new("2","Paul","Mysore")

cust1.display_details()
cust1.total_no_customers()
cust2.display_details()
cust2.total_no_customers()


[Running] ruby "/home/itsacheckmate/Practise/test.rb"
Customer id 1
Customer name Virat
Customer address Delhi
Total number of customers: 1
Customer id 2
Customer name Paul
Customer address Mysore
Total number of customers: 2

4.Local Variables: A local variable name always starts with a lowercase letter(a-z) or underscore (_). 
eg 3.0.0 :035 > _age=19
 => 19 
3.0.0 :037"> name="jaskaran"
 => "jaskaran" 
 
 
5. Ruby Constants
Constants begin with UpperCase Letter
If they are defined withing class then they can be accessed within
that module only.
And if constants are defined outside class or module then it is treated as 
globally accessable
Refrencing an uninitialized constants will produce an error

#Ruby Logical Operators

1.and operator- if both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true.
a=true
b=true

puts (a and b)

[Running] ruby "/home/itsacheckmate/Practise/test.rb"
true

2.or operator - . If any of the two operands are true, then the condition becomes true.
a=true
b=false

puts (a or b)
[Running] ruby "/home/itsacheckmate/Practise/test.rb"
true

3.Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. 
a=false
b=true

puts !(a && b)


#Ruby Ternary Operator
?:  Conditonal expression
If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y
score=50
result=score>40?'Pass':'Fail'
puts result
[Running] ruby "/home/itsacheckmate/Practise/test.rb"
Pass


Ruby Range Operator
It is used to create a range of successive values - 
consisting of a start value, an end value, and a 
range of values in between.

The two-dot form creates an inclusive range, 
while the three-dot form creates a range that 
excludes the specified high value.
so 1..10 is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
and 1...10 is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

$, =", "
range_op=(7 ..10).to_a
puts "#{range_op}"

range_op1=(7 ... 10).to_a
puts "#{range_op1}"
