BDD(Behaviour driven development) - is a development technique which focuses more on a software application's behaviour.It creates an executable specification that fails because the respective feature dosen't exist, then writing the simplest code that can make the specification pass and as a result we get the required behaviour implemented in the system.It is a team methodology where developer,customer,qas are involved.

process - 
1.write behaviour of application
2.write automated scripts
3.implement the functional code.
4.check behaviour is succesful if not fix it
5.organize code.
6.repeat steps for another behaviour

TDD(test driven development) - is a development which focuses more on the implementation of a feature of a software application.It mainly refers to write a test case that fails because the specified functionality dosent exist and after that update the code can make the test case pass and as a result we get the feature implemented in it.
Process of TDD -
1.add test case
2.run the test case and watch test case fails
3.update the code
4.run the test case again
5.repeat steps for another test case

In both cases developer write test before writing code to make the test pass.
BDD is designed to test an application's behaviour from the end user's standpoint whereas TDD is focused on testinf smaller piece of functionality in isolation.
