The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action.It also generate paths and URLs. Rails router deals URLs in a different way from other language routers. It determines controller, parameters and action for the request.
Basically a router is a way to redirect incoming requests to controllers and actions. It replaces mod_rewrite rules. One best thing is that, in Rails routing works with any web server.
Rails handles routing via config/routes.rb file rather than relying on the web server to control URL routing. This file controls every single aspect of your URLs, like rules that try to match the URL path for a request and decides where to direct that request.

Main purpose of Rails routers is explained below:
Connecting URLs to code
Generating paths and URLs from code

Action Controller is the C in MVC. After the router has determined which controller to use for a request, the controller is responsible for making sense of the request and producing the appropriate output.
A controller can thus be thought of as a middleman between models and views. It makes the model data available to the view, so it can display that data to the user, and it saves or updates user data to the model.

Controller Naming Convention-
The naming convention of controllers in Rails favors pluralization of the last word in the controller's name, although it is not strictly required (e.g. ApplicationController). For example, ClientsController is preferable to ClientController, SiteAdminsController is preferable to SiteAdminController or SitesAdminsController, and so on.

Methods and Actions -
A controller is a Ruby class which inherits from ApplicationController and has methods just like any other class. When your application receives a request, the routing will determine which controller and action to run, then Rails creates an instance of that controller and runs the method with the same name as the action.

ApplicationController inherits from ActionController::Base, which defines a number of helpful methods.
Only public methods are callable as actions. It is a best practice to lower the visibility of methods (with private or protected) which are not intended to be actions, like auxiliary methods or filters.

Parameters - 
You will probably want to access data sent in by the user or other parameters in your controller actions. There are two kinds of parameters possible in a web application. The first are parameters that are sent as part of the URL, called query string parameters. The query string is everything after "?" in the URL. The second type of parameter is usually referred to as POST data. This information usually comes from an HTML form which has been filled in by the user. It's called POST data because it can only be sent as part of an HTTP POST request. Rails does not make any distinction between query string parameters and POST parameters, and both are available in the params hash in your controller.

Types of HTTP request methods

The application receives an HTTP request which carries along with it a method which could be:

GET - Retrieve a resource. To navigate directly to a page or by using Google, get HTTP method is used.a search page should use GET to get data

POST - Create a resource. form that changes your password should use POST.POST is used to insert/update remote data.POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

PUT - Completely update a resource. Updating user profile on a website uses patch with web frameworks that support it.

PATCH - Partially update a resource. It is used to only update the password for a user profile on a website.
 Fields that need to be updated by the client, only that field is updated without modifying the other field.

DELETE - Delete a resource. The HTTP DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server.

These methods determine which controller action method is called.


A web server accepts and fulfills requests from clients for static content (i.e., HTML pages, files, images, and videos) from a website. Web servers handle HTTP requests and responses only.

An application server exposes business logic to the clients, which generates dynamic content. It is a software framework that transforms data to provide the specialized functionality offered by a business, service, or application. Application servers enhance the interactive parts of a website that can appear differently depending on the context of the request.

Web Server ->

Deliver static content.
Content is delivered using the HTTP protocol only.
Serves only web-based applications.
No support for multi-threading.
Facilitates web traffic that is not very resource intensive.

Application Server ->

Delivers dynamic content.
Provides business logic to application programs using several protocols (including HTTP).
Can serve web and enterprise-based applications.
Uses multi-threading to support multiple requests in parallel.
Facilitates longer running processes that are very resource-intensive​.

REST refers to manipulating data through HTTP commands, and an ideology for how to streamline the relationship between the data that a user is manipulating on screen and the information that is saved on the server. A programmer can create a REST API that handles basic CRUD functions, but building a CRUD application in no way insinuates the use of RESTful programming.
CRUD describes an application's functions, not the relationship between web services, web applications, or APIs. 
In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands. It is a way of creating, modifying, and deleting information for the user. CRUD functions can exist in a REST API, but REST APIs are not limited to CRUD functions.

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, the four fundamental operations of data storage. Computer scientists use CRUD as a measure of an application's completion state. If an application can't perform CRUD operations, it is incomplete. 

A RESTful API is an acronym for Representational State Transfer. REST is an architectural style which defines a set of architectural constraints for stateless communication between Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. It is not a standard, so it allows developers some flexibility, but it acts as a mediator between users, clients, and resources. REST has become ubiquitous in API programming because it emphasizes scalability and greater interoperability.

A REST API sends HTTP requests to endpoints, and receives JSON files in return. The most common requests (or HTTP verbs) are:
    GET request - This request reads information from a record in the database.
    PUT request - This request changes a record's information in the database.  
    POST request - This request creates a new record in the database.  
    DELETE request - This request removes a record from the database.
    
Helpers are methods that allow you to encapsulate tasks for reuse throughout your views. 

Partial templates help you package chunks of code for reuse in your views.
 _form - convention to tell ruby that this is a partial template  
 
 
 Delete and Destroy - 
 1.Delete and destroy require and ID and an existing record.
 2.Delete uses #find
 3.Destroy uses #find and #destroy

A member route will require an ID, because it acts on a member. A collection route doesn't because it acts on a collection of objects. Preview is an example of a member route, because it acts on (and displays) a single object. Search is an example of a collection route, because it acts on (and displays) a collection of objects.
index,create,new - collection methods

If do not provide member or collection action by default it is member action.

Namespace routing is used when you want to organize a group of controllers under a namespace.
When you use namespace, it will prefix the URL path for the specified resources, and try to locate the controller under a module named in the same manner as the namespace.
Namespaces are used to organize a group of controllers. For example, you may wish to organize a group of controllers that are only accessible by the admin of your app, under the Admin:: namespac

Both scope and namespace are scoping a set of routes to the given default options.
Except that there are no default options for scope, and for namespace :path, :as, :module, :shallow_path and :shallow_prefix options all default to the name of the namespace. 

scope supports three options: module, path and as.
If you take a deep look into scope and namespace default behaviour, you will find that scope by default supports only :path option, where as namespace supports three options module, path and as by default.

Active Storage -
1. Allow you to upload files to Cloud Storage Services like AWS S3,Google Cloud Storage,Microsoft Azure Storage.
2.By default it comes with local disk storage.

Setup - rails active_storage:install
rails db:migrate

Declaring Active Storage Services
config/storage.yml

helper method defined inside a controller are not treated as other action as defined in the controller.
it has 2 advantage-
you can use this method into the controller and still manage viewport
this helper method keyword it makes this method makes it available for views as well.
when you define helper method into controller, that is avalaible for the only controller it is defined in.


Webpacker - 
Webpacker is a Rails wrapper around the webpack.
The goal of webpack, or any front-end build system, is to allow you to write your front-end code in a way that is convenient for developers and then package that code in a way that is convenient for browsers. With webpack, you can manage JavaScript, CSS, and static assets like images or fonts. Webpack will allow you to write your code, reference other code in your application, transform your code, and combine your code into easily downloadable packs.

Sprockets vs Webpacker - 
Webpacker is better to use over Sprocket if you work with modern javascript and rails.

Sprockets is better choice than webpacker if you are working with legacy application, because migration might be costly.
In rails 7, webpacker is not default option but an optional one.
Webpack helps us organize our JavaScript file code to avoid errors and improve a website’s performance. It organizes the code into bundles.
Webpacker is a tool that integrates Webpack with a Rails application. It makes it easy to configure and develop JavaScript-like applications and optimize them for the production environment.
To include Webpacker in a new project, add --webpack to the rails new command. To add Webpacker to an existing project, add the webpacker gem to the project's Gemfile, run bundle install, and then run bin/rails webpacker:install.

ActionMailer - 
Action Mailer allows you to send emails from your application using mailer classes and views.

mailer action does not require routing to get invoked and every mailer action must have view template.
itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Training/rails/book_collection$ rails g mailer crud_notification create_notification update_notification delete_notification
      create  app/mailers/crud_notification_mailer.rb
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/crud_notification_mailer
      create    app/views/crud_notification_mailer/create_notification.text.erb
      create    app/views/crud_notification_mailer/create_notification.html.erb
      create    app/views/crud_notification_mailer/update_notification.text.erb
      create    app/views/crud_notification_mailer/update_notification.html.erb
      create    app/views/crud_notification_mailer/delete_notification.text.erb
      create    app/views/crud_notification_mailer/delete_notification.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/mailers/crud_notification_mailer_test.rb
      create    test/mailers/previews/crud_notification_mailer_preview.rb

Action Text brings rich text content and editing to Rails. It includes the Trix editor that handles everything from formatting to links to quotes to lists to embedded images and galleries. The rich text content generated by the Trix editor is saved in its own RichText model that's associated with any existing Active Record model in the application. Any embedded images (or other attachments) are automatically stored using Active Storage and associated with the included RichText model.

itsacheckmate@itscheckmate:~/Training/rails/book_collection$ rails action_text:install
      append  app/javascript/application.js
      append  config/importmap.rb
      create  app/assets/stylesheets/actiontext.css
To use the Trix editor, you must require 'app/assets/stylesheets/actiontext.css' in your base stylesheet.
      create  app/views/active_storage/blobs/_blob.html.erb
      create  app/views/layouts/action_text/contents/_content.html.erb
Ensure image_processing gem has been enabled so image uploads will work (remember to bundle!)
        gsub  Gemfile
       rails  railties:install:migrations FROM=active_storage,action_text
Copied migration 20220628105348_create_action_text_tables.action_text.rb from action_text

Rake utility allows you to create a job/task which uses rails environment. So say, you want to count the votes a user has given to an article and save it somewhere. You write a rake job, in which you can use Rails models and other helpers and get it done without going away from Rails.
